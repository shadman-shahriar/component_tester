# Component Tester
Calibration
In case your tester says "Not Calibrated"

You will need two capacitors, one with values >100nF and another with 4-35nF.

To begin calibration, short the three probes together.
When it says "Selftest?", long-press the button for 2 seconds.
Follow the instructions on the screen. When prompted for a capacitor >100nF. Plug it between pins 1 and 3. Following it will prompt for a capacitor with a value between 4nF and 35nF. Plug it in.
The Tester will prompt as "Test Completed".
You have successfully calibrated the tester ðŸ™Œ
